This course is an internship at a work place of our choosing. I decided to do my LIA at [Bluescreen](https://www.bluescreen.se/) which is a company that work with IT solutions and Web development. 
My first assignment was to produce a Dropbox app that is to be implemented into their own project managment system.
The app I created is linked to the users Dropbox. The design is simple since I focused on functionality and Bluescreen will change it and use the same design as thier system when implementing it.

I am using this project as my graduation work so I have changed the connection and urls to localhost instead of ftp.
